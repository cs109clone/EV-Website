            <p>The project takes a deep dive into electric vehicle usage in the US. It is going to tell the story for a reader who could be a possible buyer of an electric vehicle in the near future. That mean it gives a general overview about electric vehicle technologies and how the environment can benefit from using it. Consequently that means guiding the reader through model overviews / market shares / sales statistics towards important usage questions like service and charging network.</p>
