                Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes which
                bite
                between dusk and dawn. People infected with malaria often experience fever, chills and flu-like
                illness

                first.

                    Malaria in humans is caused by five species of parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium.
                    Four of these – P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale – are human malaria species that
                    are
                    spread
                    from one person to another via the bite of female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. There are about
                    400
                    different species of Anopheles mosquitoes, but only 30 of these are vectors of major importance. In
                    recent
                    years, human cases of malaria due to P. knowlesi have been recorded – this species causes malaria
                    among
                    monkeys in certain forested areas of South-East Asia. Current information suggests that P. knowlesi
                    malaria
                    is
                    not spread from person to person, but rather occurs in people when an Anopheles mosquito infected by
                    a
                    monkey then bites and infects humans (zoonotic transmission). P. falciparum and P. vivax are the
                    most
                    prevalent, and P. falciparum is the most dangerous, with the highest rates of complications and
                    mortality.
                    This deadly form of malaria is a serious public health concern in most countries in sub-Saharan
                    Africa.

                    An increasing number of countries are moving towards elimination of malaria.
                    Whereas only 13 countries were estimated to have fewer than 1000 malaria cases in 2000, 33
                    countries
                    are
                    estimated to have achieved this milestone in 2015.<br>
                    Global financing for malaria control increased from an estimated
                    US$ 960 million in 2005 to US$ 2.5 billion in 2014.

        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>
                To address remaining challenges in global malaria control and elimination, WHO has developed the
                Global
                Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030. Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, the
                strategy
                provides a technical framework for all endemic countries as they work towards malaria control and
                elimination.
                This Global Technical Strategy sets ambitious but achievable goals for 2030, including: reducing
                malaria
                case
                incidence by at least 90%; reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90%; eliminating malaria in
                at
                least 35
                countries; preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free. To achieve
                these
                targets,
                annual funding for malaria will need to triple over the next 15-year period, from US$ 2.7 billion
                (current level of
                spending) to US$ 8.7 billion by 2030.

        <h2> Recommendations</h2>
        <div class="col-sm-12">
            <p>
                International travellers could be at risk of malaria infection in 97 countries around the world,
                mostly
                in Africa,
                Asia and the Americas.
                Prevention of mosquito bites between dusk and dawn is the first line of defence against malaria.
                Measures to
                prevent mosquito bites include sleeping under long-lasting insecticidal nets, and using protective
                clothing and
                insect repellents. Depending on the malaria risk in the area to be visited, international travellers
                may
                also need
                to take preventive medication (chemoprophylaxis) prior to, during, and upon return from their
                travel.
