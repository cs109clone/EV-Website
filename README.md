# CS 171 - Electric Vehicles (EV) Website
A focused, minimum viable product (hence MVP). The project takes a deep dive into electric vehicle usage in the US. It is going to tell the story for a reader who could be a possible buyer of an electric vehicle in the near future. That mean it gives a general overview about electric vehicle technologies and how the environment can benefit from using it. Consequently that means guiding the reader through model overviews / market shares / sales statistics towards important usage questions like service and charging network.

## Project Organization
* **Issues** for individual actionable items, or bugs i.e.:
  * Design home page
  * Implement home page
* **Milestones** for "releases" or overall steps, i.e.:
  * [Single-page site](http://greenore.github.io/EV-Website)
  * [Process Book](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M83uYdwIpXW8BmJTyH1ezhldWYpx9OqnXTMCWDdt3jI/edit?usp=sharing)
  * [R-Code](https://github.com/greenore/EV-R-Code)

## Architecture/Philosophies
* HTML, CSS, and JS
* Bootstrap, JQuery, Colorbrewer & D3 as frameworks (keep it simple!)
* Mobile-friendly (check for different screen sizes)
* Prototypes in R, Accesible via iFrames
* Encapsilated code as much as possible.
